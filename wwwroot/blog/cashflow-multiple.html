    <h1 id="cashflow-multiple">Cashflow Multiple</h1>
    <p>Investing is always about exchanging money now for money later.
    So, you need to ask, “is this a good price for this investment?” Is
    the stock cheap or expensive? How economical is the price?</p>
    <p class="lead">
    The <strong>Cashflow Multiple</strong> helps answer: <em>Is the
    business cheap or expensive?</em>
    </p>
    <p>It does so by specifically answering:<br />
    <strong>How many years</strong> would it take for the business to
    earn back the price I paid for it <strong>in discretionary
    cashflow</strong>?</p>
    <p>For example, say that a stock is selling for $200 per
    share.<br />
    <!-- Image of price tag --> If the business earns $10 per share in
    discretionary cashflow, then the <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> is 20.
    “It’s 20x cashflow.”</p>
    <h3 id="pop-quiz">Pop Quiz</h3>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>If the <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> is 5, how long would it take
    for the business to earn back the price I paid for it in
    discretionary cashflow?</li>
    <li>A stock has a <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> of 9 and costs $45 per
    share. How much discretionary cashflow does the business earn per
    share?</li>
    <li>Which is the better deal: a stock with a <em>Cashflow
    Multiple</em> of 10x or a stock with a <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> of
    20x?</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="answers">Answers</h4>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>5 years</li>
    <li>$5 per share</li>
    <li>The stock with a <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> of 10x is the better
    deal. It would take 10 years for the business to earn back the price
    you paid for it. The stock with a <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> of 20x
    would take 20 years to earn back the price you paid for it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="formula">Formula</h3>
    <p>The <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> is calculated by dividing the
    price of the stock by the discretionary cashflow per share.</p>
    <p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Cashflow Multiple} &amp;= \frac{\text{Share
    Price}}{\text{Cashflow Per Share}} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\text{Market Cap}}{\text{Annual Cashflow}}
    \end{align*}
    \]</span></p>
    <h3 id="discretionary-cashflow">Discretionary Cashflow</h3>
    <p>Discretionary cashflow is the cash “left over” each year that the
    owners can direct as they please. The owners could pay the cash to
    themselves, pay down debt, retain it, or reinvest it in the
    business. The freedom to pay the cash to themselves is what makes it
    a good metric for evaluating the price of a business.</p>
    <p>When looking at financial statements you will not find a line for
    discretionary cashflow. It is not a GAAP or IFRS metric. When
    evaluating a business you should use your best understanding of the
    business and its operations to approximate discretionary cashflow.
    Remember the principle that it is better to be roughly right than
    precisely wrong.</p>
    <h3 id="so-is-it-a-good-price">So, Is it a Good Price?</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve found an estimate for the <em>Cashflow Multiple</em>
    you can compare it to other <em>Cashflow Multiples</em>. Most
    commonly you will compare it to the <em>Cashflow Multiples</em> of
    other stocks in the same industry, or to the <em>Cashflow
    Multiples</em> of the stock’s own history.</p>
    <p>For example, you follow ACME INC. and the stock has been trading
    at a <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> of 25x for the past 10 years. You
    would love to own ACME INC. but, 25x seems expensive. Then, one day,
    the stock drops to 15x. The multiple versus the historical norm
    gives you a sense that the stock is relatively cheap.</p>
    <h3 id="tie-it-to-intrinsic-value">Tie it to Intrinsic Value</h3>
    <p>Finally, you should use the <a href="/annuity">Annuity
    Calculator</a> to develop a sense for what multiples correspond to
    what rates of growth.</p>
    <p>For example, a 17x multiple may be reasonable for a business
    growing at 20% per year. But, for a business without growth
    prospects, 4x may be more reasonable.</p>
    <hr />
    <h4 id="additional-info">Additional Info</h4>
    <p>The <em>Cashflow Multiple</em> is the inverse of the <em>Cashflow
    Yield</em>.</p>
    <p>Free Cashflow (FCF) is equivalent to Discretionary Cashflow for
    the purpose of this article. While there are technical formulae for
    FCF, the purpose of either is to represent cash that can be freely
    directed by the owners.</p>
    <p>We may use the term “stock” or “business” interchangeably when
    talking of investing in the stock market. We evaluate buying stocks
    in the same way we would an entire business.</p>
    <p>GAAP and IFRS are accounting standards which dictate what items
    appear in financial statements.</p>
